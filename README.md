Pong game made with PixiJS. My son and I made this to learn Javascript and game dev. This game is only for two players, so make sure to have a friend near you.

## TODO

- paddle size relative to screen height and width ?
- better fullscreen and install UI ?

### In the future

#### power-ups
- bigger paddle
- power shot
- coin, one point
